# Datacamp - CapGemini

MAP540 - group 7

### Summary

This repository contains all code snippets related to our solution to the datacamp.
The aim was to extract the main pain points expressed by smartphones owners from a broad range of structured and unstructured data sources (Twitter, Reddit, boards, marketplaces). The scope was limited to the iPhone X and the Samsung Galaxy S8.

### Project architecture

- The EDA notebooks live in the `notebooks` folder. We dealt with text preprocessing, topic modeling and semi-supervised classification.
- The `scrapers` folder contains the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org) spiders we created to acquire the data.
